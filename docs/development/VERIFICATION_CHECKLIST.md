## üîç Quick API Test (for Issue #2)

Test the backend config API with authentication:

```bash
# 1. Login to get token
TOKEN=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"demo@example.com","password":"demo123"}' | \
  jq -r '.accessToken')

# 2. Test authenticated config update
curl -X PUT http://localhost:3001/api/config/server \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -d '{"config":{"general":{"serverName":"TestServer","port":8080,"maxConnections":1000,"timeout":30000},"inference":{"modelPath":"/test","batchSize":32,"contextLength":4096,"temperature":0.7,"topP":0.9,"threads":8},"networking":{"enableMPTCP":true,"maxSubflows":4,"congestionControl":"cubic","bufferSize":65536},"security":{"enableAuth":true,"tokenExpiry":86400,"rateLimiting":true,"maxRequestsPerMinute":60}}}'
```

## üö® If Issues Persist

### Notifications Bell Still Not Working
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Verify Header.tsx changes were applied
- Restart frontend development server

### Save Still Shows Unauthorized
- Check that config service is using authenticated API
- Verify backend is running on port 3001
- Check that JWT token is being sent in requests

---

## üéØ Success Criteria

**‚úÖ Both Issues Fixed When**:
1. Notifications bell shows dropdown when clicked
2. Server settings save without "Unauthorized" error
3. No JavaScript console errors during testing

**Ready for comprehensive testing once both manual verifications pass.**
